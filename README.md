# TaigeiDB
A website that agregates anonymous drop data and displays them in a user-friendly way. Notable features include a Relational Database, REST API for anonymous submission/queries, live search, and responsive design. The database logged over 40 million submissions, and writing low latency SQL was the biggest challenge.
